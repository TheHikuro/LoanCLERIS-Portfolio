## About me 
I'm a fullstack web developper, graduated at l'[ESGI](https://www.esgi.fr/). 
I decided to do my new Portfolio in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because it's a fast Framework with Static content for SEO. I can also change my content from the intergrated API by creating a admin panel to handle images and text content.
